# Why?

Can you think of a better way to tell today's date? No more googling the time;
simply clone this repository and `cat today` to see what the date is -- accurate
to within Eastern Standard Time only (which is the only important time zone).

## ... Okay, but really, why?

This is a cheap and easy way to fill in the Github commit graph while also
playing around with Github automation. Every 24 hours, this repo will open a
[GitHub Issue](issues) for the date being wrong -- which will trigger a Pull
Request creation that automatically fixes the date. Free Github credits!
